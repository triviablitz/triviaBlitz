// Pseudo code


// Set up global namespace object as well as init function

// Set up global namespaces variables as well as event listeners - score - timer - questionNumber - questionsArray - query selector for questions div

// Add event listener for landing page form to get game options from user 

// Take this data and use it to create a URL object to pass to our fetch request

// Create fetch request, passing URL object, get response and take the results array and remap to a new array with each index being an object containing answer, incorrect answers and question.

// create a setInterval function that will check whether the game is being run for the first time, as well as whether our timer has reached 0 and questions remain or not. 

//create display function. Create new element on page for storing questions and answers.
// clear this element each time this function is run
//take the answers array and sort in order to randomize order, then assign these answers to the innerHTML of the newly created element.
// Use the questions value to create a header
//append both elements to the required section


//If questions remain and timer has reached zero or first run is true, then run display function, reset timer to original start and increase question number. If questions remaining is 0 and timer has reached 0, present user with final score and ask if they want to play again.
